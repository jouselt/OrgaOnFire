# This is an example of very simple context switching on the MIPS CPU.
# (c) 2010, Warren Toomey, GPL3
# There are two main programs, both print out a counter, increment it
# and loop back to print it out again. main1 starts at 0 and increments
# in steps of 1. main2 starts at 10000 and increments in steps of 2.
#
# We run this file in combination with an interrupt handler that catches
# the clock tick interrupt from the Digital Lab Sim. When the tick arrives,
# the interrupt handler context switches between the two programs.
#
# There is also a main program here. As everything in this file runs in
# user mode, it cannot start the multitasking going, as it doesn't have
# the privilege to enable the interrupts in the Digital Lab Sim. Instead,
# the main program performs syscall 100, which jumps to the code in the other
# file. This sets up the process control blocks (PCBs) for both programs, and
# starts one of them running. In other words, the CPU never returns back to main.
